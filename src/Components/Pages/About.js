            <p>Hello! My name is Ariana, and I design and develop websites. My interest in web development came in 2019 when I decided to learn a new skill.

                Fast forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working on multiple student-led projects and organizations. My main focus these days is creating beautiful, accessible digital experiences for a variety of clients.
